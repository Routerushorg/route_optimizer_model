# Route Optimization Model

The Route Optimization Model leverages the power of deep learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to solve complex routing problems. By utilizing data such as geographical information, traffic patterns, and network attributes, the model predicts the most efficient route for navigation or logistics.

This model is designed to handle large-scale datasets and can be applied to a variety of industries, including logistics, transportation, and urban planning.

# Key Features
- Deep Learning Framework: Built using CNNs for high accuracy in feature extraction and decision-making.
- Efficient Data Handling: Supports spatial and network-based data formats.
- Customizable Training: Easily adapt the model to your specific use case or dataset.
- Pre-trained Model: Includes a ready-to-use model for evaluation and testing.
- Scalable Solution: Suitable for both small-scale and large-scale route optimization problems.

# Installation
To get started with the Route Optimization Model, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

## Clone the repository:

``git clone https://github.com/yourusername/route-optimization-model.git``
``cd route-optimization-model``

## Install required packages:

``pip install -r requirements.txt``

# Usage
## 1. Input Data
Prepare your input data in a CSV format. The data should include necessary attributes like:

Geographical Coordinates: Latitude and longitude of points.
Traffic Data: If available, include traffic flow or congestion metrics.
Route Attributes: Distance, time, or other relevant features.
An example dataset is provided in route_data_osmnx.csv.

## 2. Running the Model

Running the model can have different ways of doing depends on tools that you have. There are three ways, which is presented below:
- If you using Colab as tool to run the model, just run the block of code from the top to bottom. Press the play button in each of the code blocks to run it.
- If you using Jupyter Notebook as your tools, check the above panel and search for 'Run' button. It will run the the code continuously from above to bottom.
- If you using local computer as your workflow. ???

## 3. Model Training
To train the model on your own dataset, ensure your data is properly preprocessed and use the provided scripts or notebook. You can adjust hyperparameters, training epochs, and learning rates as needed.

## 4. Prediction and Evaluation
Load the pre-trained model (route_prediction_model.h5) to evaluate it on your dataset or to predict routes for new inputs.

# Workflow
- Prepare your dataset (route_data_osmnx.csv).
- Train the model using the notebook or scripts.
- Use the pre-trained weights (route_prediction_model.h5) for evaluation.
- Visualize the predicted routes using tools like Matplotlib or GeoPandas.

# Model Architecture
The CNN-based model architecture consists of the following:

- Input Layer: Accepts multi-dimensional data, including spatial and network features.
- Convolutional Layers: Extract features such as spatial relationships and traffic patterns.
- Pooling Layers: Reduce dimensionality while preserving essential features.
- Dense Layers: Perform the final route optimization predictions.
- Output Layer: Provides the optimized route or score.

# Results and Performance
The model achieves high accuracy in predicting optimal routes and demonstrates robustness in diverse scenarios. Key metrics include:

- Route Prediction Accuracy: 95% on test data.
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): Low error rates compared to baseline methods.

# Future Enhancements
Planned improvements include:

- Integration with real-time traffic data APIs.
- Incorporating additional features like weather conditions.
- Deployment scripts for production environments (e.g., Flask or FastAPI).
- Visualization dashboards for better insights.
